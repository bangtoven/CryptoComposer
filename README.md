### [Design patterns](./design_pattern_decisions.md)

### [Security measures](./avoiding_common_attacks.md)

### Smart contracts

Bootstraped with [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle),
and deployed on
[Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xadf78367db78437a371dd07dc6fef826b332aa23),
[Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xfcDD8e6455624CCb94C6641E97ED5bf7A96F9384),
and [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x91922dc7384b62F5ae2f3e12D26597C36aD3b80E)
([deployed_address.txt](./deployed_address.txt))

```
- contracts
 - CryptoComposer.sol   - deployed. checks payment and call minter
 - CryptoNFTMinter.sol  - inherited by CryptoComposer. manages minting
 - CryptoComposerToken.sol       - ERC20 token to use CryptoComposer.
 - CryptoComposerTokenVendor.sol - manages price and minting of CCT.
- migrations
- tests
```

### Frontend

React app built with [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) accessible at https://crypto-composer.bangtoven.com/

Referenced [Reactronica](https://github.com/unkleho/reactronica) to build DAWStepsEditor

```
- pages
- components
- hooks
- styles
- public
```

## Instructions

### Install and migration

```sh
# install frontend dependencies, smart contract tooling, and solidity libraries
yarn install

# deploy smart contracts to local network
ganache-cli -p 8545 # or Ganache GUI
truffle migrate
```

You need these local contract addresses of `CryptoComposerTokenVendor` and `CryptoComposer` later to update frontend.

> Deploy to public network: Create and fill `.secret` and `.infura_api_key` files, then run `truffle migrate --network {NETWORK}`

### Run unit tests

```sh
ganache-cli -p 8545 # or Ganache GUI
truffle test
```

### Run frontend locally

Update contract addresses for `1337` network on `hooks/useContract.js` with addresses from the previous step.

```JavaScript
// hooks/useContract.js
...
export function useCryptoComposerContract() {
...
      [1337, `{CryptoComposer_address}`],
...

export function useCCTVendorContract() {
...
      [1337, `{CryptoComposerTokenVendor_address}`],
...
```

```sh
yarn build && yarn start
```

### Use the deployed web app

Set your local network id to `1337` and open https://crypto-composer.bangtoven.com/
